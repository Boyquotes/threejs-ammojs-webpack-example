Just an example. Not for development or production use.

Run `npm i` and `npm start`

You don't need to install three.js. Just import it using:  
`import * as THREE from '@enable3d/three-wrapper/dist'`

You can use code from the three.js examples folder:  
`import { OrbitControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls'`
